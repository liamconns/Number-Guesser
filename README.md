# Number Guesser
In my efforts to learn Python, I made this simple "Number Guesser" program.
The user inputs a number between 1 and 100. From there, the program tells the user if it is "too high" or "too low" of a guess.
This process repeats until the user gets the correct number and they are congratulated and given the option to play again
